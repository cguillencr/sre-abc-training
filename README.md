## Class 7 - SRE Observability Pillars: Metrics, Traces, and Logs

### 1. Metrics
- **Metrics** are numerical values collected over time that measure the performance and health of a system.
- They are essential for identifying trends and detecting problems in the system's behavior before they escalate into incidents.
- Examples of metrics include CPU usage, latency, error rates, and network traffic.
- Metrics are used in conjunction with *Service Level Indicators (SLIs)* and *Service Level Objectives (SLOs)* to monitor and ensure system reliability.

#### 2. Traces
- **Traces** allow tracking the journey of a request through the different services and components of a distributed system.
- Traces are essential for diagnosing issues in microservices architectures where a single request may interact with multiple services.
- They provide visibility into how a transaction flows through the system, helping to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

#### 3. Logs
- **Logs** record detailed events that occur within the system, providing real-time information about its internal state.
- Logs are useful for diagnosing problems at specific moments, containing granular details about errors or particular system states.
- They are often analyzed with tools to detect patterns or anomalies.

Together, these three components (Metrics, Traces, and Logs) form the foundation of **observability**, which is crucial for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) to maintain system reliability, detect issues, and continuously improve the systems they manage.

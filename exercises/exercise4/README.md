## Introduction

This exercise will guide you through deploying a Python application to Kubernetes using Minikube with Podman as the container runtime. You will configure the deployment, expose the service, and explore the Kubernetes dashboard to observe the running application.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have completed Exercises 1â€“3. Additionally, the following tools must be installed on your system:
- **Podman**: A daemonless container engine.
- **Minikube**: A tool to set up a local Kubernetes cluster.
- **kubectl**: The command-line tool for Kubernetes.

---

## Navigate to the Application Directory

To begin, navigate to the directory for Exercise 4:

```bash
cd sre-abc-training/exercises/exercise4
```

This directory contains the necessary YAML files for the deployment and service configuration.

---

## Install Minikube on macOS

Install Minikube using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install minikube
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
minikube version
```

---

## Starting Minikube with Podman

Minikube can run with different drivers. In this exercise, we will use Podman as the container runtime. Start Minikube with the following command:

```bash
minikube start --driver=podman --container-runtime=containerd
```

Verify the Minikube setup:

```bash
minikube status
```

---

## Accessing the Kubernetes Dashboard

Minikube includes a built-in dashboard for managing Kubernetes resources visually. Launch the dashboard using:

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

> **Note:** This command locks the terminal. Open a new terminal to continue working while the dashboard is open.

---

## Deploying the Application

In this exercise, the deployment and service YAML files are already created in the `exercise4` directory. 

### Deployment YAML

The `deployment.yaml` defines the application's deployment, including the number of replicas and the container image used. It is configured to deploy the `cguillenmendez/sre-abc-training-python-app` image.

### Service YAML

The `service.yaml` configures the Kubernetes Service to expose the application using a NodePort.

### Steps to Deploy

1. Apply the Deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

2. Apply the Service:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

3. Verify the Pods:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   Wait until all pods are in the `Running` state.

4. Verify the Service:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service sre-abc-training-service
   ```

---

## Exploring the Application in the Dashboard

1. Open the Minikube dashboard:
   ```bash
   minikube dashboard
   ```

2. In the dashboard, explore:
   - **Workloads > Deployments**: Verify the `sre-abc-training-app` deployment, its replicas, and status.
   - **Network > Services**: Check the `sre-abc-training-service`, including its NodePort and associated pods.

> **Note:** Observe how the dashboard reflects the state of the cluster before and after the deployment.

---

## Final Objective

At the end of this exercise, you should accomplish the following:

> **[!IMPORTANT]**  
> Use the Minikube dashboard to visually inspect the deployment and service. Ensure all pods are running, and the application is accessible.  
> ![k8s_dashboard](k8s_dashboard.png)

---

## Cleanup

Once you have completed the exercise and confirmed the application is running and visible in the Minikube dashboard, you can clean up the resources to ensure your environment is tidy and ready for the next exercise.

### Steps to Clean Up

1. **Delete the Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
   ```
   This will delete the deployment and the associated pods.

2. **Delete the Service**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete -f service.yaml
   ```
   This will delete the service that exposed the application.

3. **Verify All Resources Are Deleted**:
   Check that there are no running pods or services in the default namespace:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   The output should show:
   ```
   No resources found in default namespace.
   ```

4. **List Remaining Files**:
   Confirm that only your YAML files and documentation remain in the directory:
   ```bash
   ls -l
   ```
   You should see an output like:
   ```

   -rw-r--r--  1 rsergio  staff     252 Dec 27 12:50 service.yaml
   ```

By following these steps, you ensure that your environment is clean and ready for subsequent exercises.

# Practice 2 â€“ Loops and Conditions

## Objective

This practice introduces conditional logic and loop control structures.

## Instructions

Create a script that:

1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Determines whether the number is **even** or **odd** using the modulo operator (`%`).
3. Counts down from the entered number to zero, printing each number and its parity.

## Example Output

```
Enter a number: 5
5 is odd
4
3 is odd
2
1 is odd
0
```

## Tips

- Use a `for` or `while` loop to iterate backwards.
- Use the modulo operator `%` to check if a number is even (`num % 2 == 0`).
- Use `print()` statements inside the loop for conditional messages.
```

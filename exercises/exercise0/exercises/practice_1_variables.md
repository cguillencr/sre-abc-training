# Practice 1 – Variables and Input

## Objective

In this practice exercise, you will write a basic Python program that uses variables and user input. This will help reinforce your understanding of:

- Variable declaration
- The `input()` function
- String formatting

---

## Instructions

1. Ask the user to enter their **name**.
2. Ask the user to enter their **age**.
3. Store these values in appropriate variables.
4. Display a message such as:  
   `"Hello, NAME! You are AGE years old."`

---

## Example Output

```text
What is your name? Alex
How old are you? 25
Hello, Alex! You are 25 years old.
```

---

## Tips

- Remember to convert the input to the correct data type if needed (e.g., `int()` for age).
- Use an `f-string` or string concatenation to format your output.

---

## Challenge (Optional)

Enhance your program to include:

- A second message that calculates and displays the user’s age in 5 years.
- Example:  
  `"In 5 years, you will be 30 years old!"`

---

## Deliverable

Submit a `.py` file named `my_variables_practice.py` containing your code.
